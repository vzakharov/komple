Chrome extension that displays an autocomplete suggestion in the currently active element, taking the suggestion from an external API.

- [Load unpacked](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-form-outside-the-chrome-web-store) (for now)
- Press `Alt+K` (`Cmd+K` on a Mac) to [configure endpoint, api key](https://gyazo.com/28debc2dee5d767cecfd0b6585ba6bca),and other settings if you want.
- You can add as many endpoints as you want, with different parameters such as temperature, number of tokens, etc., according to the specific API’s requirements.
- While typing, press `Ctrl+Space` to generate the autocomplete suggestion. Undo using standard keyboard shortcuts.
- If you press `Alt+K` while in a text field, a [helper popover](https://gyazo.com/61a6bf6e98c50f337fe94c8cac4789b7) will appear, where you can quickly switch between different endpoints using keyboard shortcuts, open the configuration modal, or copy the prompt that is used behind the scenes to clipboard.

It’s work in progress, so don’t expect it to work perfectly.
