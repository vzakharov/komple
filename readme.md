Chrome extension that displays an autocomplete suggestion in the currently active element, taking the suggestion from an external API.

- [Load unpacked](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-form-outside-the-chrome-web-store) (for now)
- Press `Alt+K` to configure endpoint & api key (and other settings if you want)
- While typing, type in two backslahes to get the autocomplete suggestion

It’s work in progress, so don’t expect it to work perfectly.
